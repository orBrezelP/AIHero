# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a [brief description of the project]. It includes a backend built with [relevant technology] and a frontend developed using [frontend framework]. Docker is used to containerize the application for easy deployment and setup.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (version 20.x or above)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (version 2.x or above)
- Node.js (if frontend dependencies need to be managed)

```

## Setup Instructions

### Running the Project with Docker

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application:

   - Backend: Visit `http://localhost:<backend-port>`
   - Frontend: Visit `http://localhost:<frontend-port>`

### Managing Dependencies

#### Backend

The backend dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. These will be installed automatically by Docker. To install them manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Frontend

The frontend dependencies are managed via Node.js. To install them:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

### Backend

To run the backend locally without Docker:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Frontend

To run the frontend locally:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration).

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are configured (add these to a `.env` file if applicable):

- `DB_HOST` - Database host
- `DB_USER` - Database user
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- [Any other relevant variables]

## Additional Notes

- Make sure ports defined in `docker-compose.yaml` and frontend configuration files are not conflicting.
- Modify configurations in `docker/` and `src/` as needed to match your environment.
